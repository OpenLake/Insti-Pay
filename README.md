# ðŸ’° Welcome to Insti-Pay! ðŸ‘‹ 
A payment infrastructure to cater to transactional needs within IIT Bhilai, among all institutes.
There are financial transactions ingrained in the day-to-day life of every student, faculty, and staff member in an educational institution. In a nutshell, the institute is an economy of its own. From students needing to take printouts to faculty and staff dining impromptu in one of the instituteâ€™s mess facilities, every transaction uses the Indian Rupee. Each such transaction traverses the internet and involves atleast a couple of banking institutions. We envision a simple system of points. Every user shall be able to load some amount of money to their account which is linked to their ID card (Which has a chip on them). 
Further aspects of the project may include the following: With help from spending analytics APIs, users may be allowed a certain amount of low-interest credit for the duration of a semester, which shall be guaranteed by the institute safety deposit paid each semester. Such an app must also bear the potential to ensure the efficient use of free and paid resources within the campus and should also be easy to adopt by the student and other stakeholders.
Students participating in any of the projects will be eligible to apply for fellowship grants under IBITF and may receive additional funding for the next 6 months to pursue a project/problem statement in the FinTech domain.
